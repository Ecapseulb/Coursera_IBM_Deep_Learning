## For each file we have in the title the library it uses.

## (Keras) Classification and Captioning Aircraft Damage Using Pretrained Models
We classify aircraft damage using a pre-trained VGG16 model and generate captions using a Transformer-based pretrained model.

## (PyTorch) Deep Neural Network for Breast Cancer Classification
We use PyTorch to build and train a deep neural network for classification. The dataset used is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set.

## (PyTorch) Fashion MNIST Project
We classify Fashion-MNIST dataset using convolutional neural networks.

## (PyTorch) League of Legends Match Predictor
We build a logistic regression model aimed at predicting the outcomes of League of Legends matches.

## (Tensorflow) Classify Waste Products Using TL- FT
We classify waste products using transfer learning. The pre-trained model which we used is VGG16 model.

## (Tensorflow) Fruit Classification
We build a fruit image classifier using transfer learning. The pre-trained model which we used is VGG16 model.
